Synthesized AAC voice for design on a 7" tablet (only landscape).

## Description

This project was born with the purpose of giving voice to a mute boy named Eros, hence Eros's Voice. I have been working as a software engineer since 2019, and I had an old tablet lying around gathering dust, which made me realize that each of us, in our own small way, can have a positive impact on the lives of others. Currently, it's a simple and somewhat rudimentary project, but in my spare time, I will continue to develop and improve it to reach as many people as possible.
